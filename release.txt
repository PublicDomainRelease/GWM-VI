o Version 1.0.1 08/07/2014

A new variable called EpsQnet is now supported in the GWM-VI Control input 
file.  EpsQnet applies when MNW2 multi-node wells are used as flow-rate 
decision variables.  Please see Input_instructions_GWM-VI_v1.0.1.pdf in the 
doc folder for details.

In the earlier version of GWM-VI, certain messages, including some error 
messages, were not being saved.  Now, these messages are written to file
messages_from_gwmvi.txt.

The following bugs have been fixed:

1. Execution failed when there were no managed wells simulated by the 
Well Package.

2. An infinite loop could happen under any of the following conditions:
    a. Modflow did not converge,
    b. A managed well cell (WEL or MNW2) went dry, or
    c. A constraint cell went dry.

3. Execution failed when flow-rate decision variables were simulated with
the MNW2 Package and the original MNW2 input file specified 0 wells.

o Version 1.0.0 12/05/2013

This version is the initial release.
